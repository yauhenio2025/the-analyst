"""Engine definition schemas for Analyzer v2.

Pure analytical capability definitions - NO execution logic.
These schemas define what engines ARE, not how they RUN.

MIGRATION NOTES (2026-01-29):
- BREAKING CHANGE: extraction_prompt, curation_prompt, concretization_prompt removed
- NEW: stage_context field with StageContext for template composition
- Prompts are now composed at runtime from generic templates + engine context
- See src/stages/ for template system
- Migration script: scripts/migrate_engines_to_stages.py
