"""Capability-based engine definition schemas for Analyzer v2.

This is the NEW engine definition format that describes WHAT an engine
investigates (the problematique, analytical dimensions, capabilities)
rather than HOW it formats output (canonical schemas, extraction steps).

The core insight: define the analytical WHAT richly, let LLMs determine
the HOW (output structure, number of passes, depth) at runtime.

These schemas coexist with the original EngineDefinition in schemas.py.
Engines can have both formats during the migration period.

See docs/refactoring_engines.md and docs/plain_text_architecture.md
for the architectural rationale.
